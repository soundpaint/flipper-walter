# flipper-walter

This ongoing project is about a flipper designed and constructed in
the early 70s by my father, Walter Reuter (sen), which I am going to
re-animate, overhaul and modernize.

## Step 1: Documentation
I have documented the flipper with a series of photo shoots, including
inside details.  Since github is more about code than photos, I upload
the photos elsewhere (TODO).

## Step 2: Reverse Engineering
So far, I have reverse engineered the complete game automaton,
resulting in schematic diagrams in the [schematics
directory](schematics).

## Step 3: Make It Run Again (TODO)
Basically, the flipper still works fine, but some minor details need
overhaul.  Besides some general cleaning, in particular, most of the
rubber bands have become brittle over time and need to be replaced.

## Step 4: Make It Safe (TODO)
While the flipper was technically fully ok regarding the standards as
of the early 70s, it does not at all comply with today's regulations.
As such, the flipper can currently be legally operated only in a safe
environment such as a laboratory.  Speciifically, it does not confirm
to current electromagnetic radiation regulations.  Also, it does not
comply with some of the current VDE regulations such as those
referring to the separation of 230V primary net voltage and secondary
circuits.

## Step 5: Pimp It Up! (TODO)
The goal of this step is to modernize the flipper.  Specifically,

* replace old filament light bulbs and neon tubes with energy-saving
  LED lamps,

* replace game logic that is currently implemented with relays with
  programmable and thus flexible microcontroller design.

However, the overall “mechanical feeling” of the flipper should
survive as much as possible.  Specifically, the old relay technology
with its audible clicks significantly contributes this feeling and
sentiment, as well as the warm light spectrum of the old filament
light bulbs.
